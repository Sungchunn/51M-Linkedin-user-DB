# Handoff Log (Reverse‑Chronological)

This log captures short handovers after each meaningful change so multiple AI agents (and humans) can stay aligned.

Template (copy/paste):

- Date/Time (UTC): YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM
- Author: YourName (Claude/GPT/Human)
- Change: One‑line summary
- Details: 2–3 bullets on approach/constraints
- Impacts: API/UX/security/perf (as applicable)
- Next: What you expect the other agent to do

- Date/Time (UTC): 2025‑10‑21 04:15
- Author: Claude (Theme Documentation & Guidelines)
- Change: Created comprehensive theme guidelines and updated agent documentation
- Details:
  - Created docs/THEME_GUIDELINES.md with complete UI/theme standards (colors, typography, components, patterns)
  - Documented signature white glow effect implementation with ripple animation
  - Added new page template and pre-commit checklist for consistency
  - Updated docs/agents/agent.md with UI/Theme Guidelines section
  - Includes CSS variables reference, common patterns, and best practices
  - Updated project status: Phase 4 Complete - Authentication & API System Live
- Impacts:
  - Documentation: All future pages should reference THEME_GUIDELINES.md for consistent styling
  - UX: Ensures dark minimal aesthetic with signature glow remains consistent across new pages
  - Developer Experience: Clear patterns and examples for creating new frontend pages
- Next:
  - Reference THEME_GUIDELINES.md when creating any new frontend pages
  - Use the new page template and checklist before committing UI changes
  - Consider adding automated theme linting/validation in the future

- Date/Time (UTC): 2025‑10‑21 03:30
- Author: Claude (Authentication System Implementation)
- Change: Implemented complete user authentication and API key generation system
- Details:
  - Added JWT-based authentication with access (24h) and refresh tokens (30d)
  - Created database schema: users, api_keys, refresh_tokens, audit_log tables
  - Implemented auth endpoints: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/me, /auth/api-keys (CRUD)
  - Built frontend: login.html (login/register), dashboard.html (API key management)
  - Users can register, login, generate API keys with custom scopes (search:read, export:read, pii:read)
  - API keys use SHA-256 hashing, shown only once on creation
- Impacts:
  - API: New auth routes at /auth/* with Bearer token authentication
  - UX: Users must login to access dashboard and generate API keys
  - Security: Passwords hashed with bcrypt, JWT tokens for session management
  - Database: 4 new tables with proper indexes and constraints
- Next:
  - Test complete flow: register → login → create API key → use key with search endpoint
  - Fix bcrypt compatibility warning (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)
  - Optional: Add admin panel to manage all users and API keys

- Date/Time (UTC): 2025‑10‑20 17:30
- Author: GPT (WebApp)
- Change: Reverted to known‑good commit f1f394c; stabilized filters; kept export guard and cache‑busting
- Details:
  - Restored behavior before regressions; export allows query OR filter
  - Frontend loads updated `results.js` via cache‑busting
- Impacts: Filters and exports behave as expected; baseline stable
- Next: If enabling auth/keys/scopes again, apply incrementally with filter endpoints untouched
